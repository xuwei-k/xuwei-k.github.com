/**
 * An {@link Executor} that provides methods to manage termination and
 * methods that can produce a {@link Future} for tracking progress of
 * one or more asynchronous tasks.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; An &lt;tt&gt;ExecutorService&lt;/tt&gt; can be shut down, which will cause
 * it to reject new tasks.  Two different methods are provided for
 * shutting down an &lt;tt&gt;ExecutorService&lt;/tt&gt;. The {@link #shutdown}
 * method will allow previously submitted tasks to execute before
 * terminating, while the {@link #shutdownNow} method prevents waiting
 * tasks from starting and attempts to stop currently executing tasks.
 * Upon termination, an executor has no tasks actively executing, no
 * tasks awaiting execution, and no new tasks can be submitted.  An
 * unused &lt;tt&gt;ExecutorService&lt;/tt&gt; should be shut down to allow
 * reclamation of its resources.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Method &lt;tt&gt;submit&lt;/tt&gt; extends base method {@link
 * Executor#execute} by creating and returning a {@link Future} that
 * can be used to cancel execution and/or wait for completion.
 * Methods &lt;tt&gt;invokeAny&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;invokeAll&lt;/tt&gt; perform the most
 * commonly useful forms of bulk execution, executing a collection of
 * tasks and then waiting for at least one, or all, to
 * complete. (Class {@link ExecutorCompletionService} can be used to
 * write customized variants of these methods.)
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The {@link Executors} class provides factory methods for the
 * executor services provided in this package.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Usage Example&lt;/h3&gt;
 *
 * Here is a sketch of a network service in which threads in a thread
 * pool service incoming requests. It uses the preconfigured {@link
 * Executors#newFixedThreadPool} factory method:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * class NetworkService implements Runnable {
 *   private final ServerSocket serverSocket;
 *   private final ExecutorService pool;
 *
 *   public NetworkService(int port, int poolSize)
 *       throws IOException {
 *     serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
 *     pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(poolSize);
 *   }
 *
 *   public void run() { // run the service
 *     try {
 *       for (;;) {
 *         pool.execute(new Handler(serverSocket.accept()));
 *       }
 *     } catch (IOException ex) {
 *       pool.shutdown();
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * class Handler implements Runnable {
 *   private final Socket socket;
 *   Handler(Socket socket) { this.socket = socket; }
 *   public void run() {
 *     // read and service request on socket
 *   }
 * }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * The following method shuts down an &lt;tt&gt;ExecutorService&lt;/tt&gt; in two phases,
 * first by calling &lt;tt&gt;shutdown&lt;/tt&gt; to reject incoming tasks, and then
 * calling &lt;tt&gt;shutdownNow&lt;/tt&gt;, if necessary, to cancel any lingering tasks:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * void shutdownAndAwaitTermination(ExecutorService pool) {
 *   pool.shutdown(); // Disable new tasks from being submitted
 *   try {
 *     // Wait a while for existing tasks to terminate
 *     if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
 *       pool.shutdownNow(); // Cancel currently executing tasks
 *       // Wait a while for tasks to respond to being cancelled
 *       if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS))
 *           System.err.println(&quot;Pool did not terminate&quot;);
 *     }
 *   } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
 *     // (Re-)Cancel if current thread also interrupted
 *     pool.shutdownNow();
 *     // Preserve interrupt status
 *     Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
 *   }
 * }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to the
 * submission of a {@code Runnable} or {@code Callable} task to an
 * {@code ExecutorService}
 * &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 * any actions taken by that task, which in turn &lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt; the
 * result is retrieved via {@code Future.get()}.
 *
 * @since 1.5
