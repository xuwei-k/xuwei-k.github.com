 *  The `scala.language` object controls the language features available to the programmer, as proposed in the
 *  [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nlkvpoIRkx7at1qJEZafJwthZ3GeIklTFhqmXMvTX9Q/edit '''SIP-18 document''']].
 *
 *  Each of these features has to be explicitly imported into the current scope to become available:
 *  {{{
 *     import language.postfixOps // or language._
 *     List(1, 2, 3) reverse
 *  }}}
 *
 *  The language features are:
 *   - [[dynamics            `dynamics`]]            enables defining calls rewriting using the [[scala.Dynamic `Dynamic`]] trait
 *   - [[postfixOps          `postfixOps`]]          enables postfix operators
 *   - [[reflectiveCalls     `reflectiveCalls`]]     enables using structural types
 *   - [[implicitConversions `implicitConversions`]] enables defining implicit methods and members
 *   - [[higherKinds         `higherKinds`]]         enables writing higher-kinded types
 *   - [[existentials        `existentials`]]        enables writing existential types
 *   - [[experimental        `experimental`]]        contains newer features that have not yet been tested in production

  <span class="comment">/** Only where this flag is enabled, higher-kinded types can be written.
   *
   *  '''Why keep the feature?''' Higher-kinded types enable the definition of very general
   *  abstractions such as functor, monad, or arrow. A significant set of advanced
   *  libraries relies on them. Higher-kinded types are also at the core of the
   *  scala-virtualized effort to produce high-performance parallel DSLs through staging.
   *
   *  '''Why control it?''' Higher kinded types in Scala lead to a Turing-complete
   *  type system, where compiler termination is no longer guaranteed. They tend
   *  to be useful mostly for type-level computation and for highly generic design
   *  patterns. The level of abstraction implied by these design patterns is often
   *  a barrier to understanding for newcomers to a Scala codebase. Some syntactic
   *  aspects of higher-kinded types are hard to understand for the uninitiated and
   *  type inference is less effective for them than for normal types. Because we are
   *  not completely happy with them yet, it is possible that some aspects of
   *  higher-kinded types will change in future versions of Scala. So an explicit
   *  enabling also serves as a warning that code involving higher-kinded types
