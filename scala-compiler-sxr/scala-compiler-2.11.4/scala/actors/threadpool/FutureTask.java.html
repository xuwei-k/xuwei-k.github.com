/**
 * A cancellable asynchronous computation.  This class provides a base
 * implementation of {@link Future}, with methods to start and cancel
 * a computation, query to see if the computation is complete, and
 * retrieve the result of the computation.  The result can only be
 * retrieved when the computation has completed; the &lt;tt&gt;get&lt;/tt&gt;
 * method will block if the computation has not yet completed.  Once
 * the computation has completed, the computation cannot be restarted
 * or cancelled.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A &lt;tt&gt;FutureTask&lt;/tt&gt; can be used to wrap a {@link Callable} or
 * {@link java.lang.Runnable} object.  Because &lt;tt&gt;FutureTask&lt;/tt&gt;
 * implements &lt;tt&gt;Runnable&lt;/tt&gt;, a &lt;tt&gt;FutureTask&lt;/tt&gt; can be
 * submitted to an {@link Executor} for execution.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In addition to serving as a standalone class, this class provides
 * &lt;tt&gt;protected&lt;/tt&gt; functionality that may be useful when creating
 * customized task classes.
