 *
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt; Methods that create and return an {@link ExecutorService}
 *        set up with commonly useful configuration settings.
 *   &lt;li&gt; Methods that create and return a {@link ScheduledExecutorService}
 *        set up with commonly useful configuration settings.
 *   &lt;li&gt; Methods that create and return a &quot;wrapped&quot; ExecutorService, that
 *        disables reconfiguration by making implementation-specific methods
 *        inaccessible.
 *   &lt;li&gt; Methods that create and return a {@link ThreadFactory}
 *        that sets newly created threads to a known state.
 *   &lt;li&gt; Methods that create and return a {@link Callable}
 *        out of other closure-like forms, so they can be used
 *        in execution methods requiring &lt;tt&gt;Callable&lt;/tt&gt;.
