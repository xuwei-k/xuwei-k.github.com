/**
 * An implementation of {@link ReadWriteLock} supporting similar
 * semantics to {@link ReentrantLock}.
 * &lt;p&gt;This class has the following properties:
 *
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acquisition order&lt;/b&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The order of entry
 * to the read and write lock is unspecified, subject to reentrancy
 * constraints.  A nonfair lock that is continously contended may
 * indefinitely postpone one or more reader or writer threads, but
 * will normally have higher throughput than a fair lock.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 *
 * DEPARTURE FROM java.util.concurrent: this implementation impose
 * a writer-preferrence and thus its acquisition order may be different
 * than in java.util.concurrent.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reentrancy&lt;/b&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This lock allows both readers and writers to reacquire read or
 * write locks in the style of a {@link ReentrantLock}. Non-reentrant
 * readers are not allowed until all write locks held by the writing
 * thread have been released.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Additionally, a writer can acquire the read lock, but not
 * vice-versa.  Among other applications, reentrancy can be useful
 * when write locks are held during calls or callbacks to methods that
 * perform reads under read locks.  If a reader tries to acquire the
 * write lock it will never succeed.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lock downgrading&lt;/b&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;Reentrancy also allows downgrading from the write lock to a read lock,
 * by acquiring the write lock, then the read lock and then releasing the
 * write lock. However, upgrading from a read lock to the write lock is
 * &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; possible.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interruption of lock acquisition&lt;/b&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;The read lock and write lock both support interruption during lock
 * acquisition.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;{@link Condition} support&lt;/b&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;The write lock provides a {@link Condition} implementation that
 * behaves in the same way, with respect to the write lock, as the
 * {@link Condition} implementation provided by
 * {@link ReentrantLock#newCondition} does for {@link ReentrantLock}.
 * This {@link Condition} can, of course, only be used with the write lock.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The read lock does not support a {@link Condition} and
 * {@code readLock().newCondition()} throws
 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
 *
 * &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Instrumentation&lt;/b&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;This class supports methods to determine whether locks
 * are held or contended. These methods are designed for monitoring
 * system state, not for synchronization control.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
 * locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
 * its state when serialized.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample usages&lt;/b&gt;. Here is a code sketch showing how to exploit
 * reentrancy to perform lock downgrading after updating a cache (exception
 * handling is elided for simplicity):
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * class CachedData {
 *   Object data;
 *   volatile boolean cacheValid;
 *   ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
 *
 *   void processCachedData() {
 *     rwl.readLock().lock();
 *     if (!cacheValid) {
 *        // Must release read lock before acquiring write lock
 *        rwl.readLock().unlock();
 *        rwl.writeLock().lock();
 *        // Recheck state because another thread might have acquired
 *        //   write lock and changed state before we did.
 *        if (!cacheValid) {
 *          data = ...
 *          cacheValid = true;
 *        }
 *        // Downgrade by acquiring read lock before releasing write lock
 *        rwl.readLock().lock();
 *        rwl.writeLock().unlock(); // Unlock write, still hold read
 *     }
 *
 *     use(data);
 *     rwl.readLock().unlock();
 *   }
 * }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * ReentrantReadWriteLocks can be used to improve concurrency in some
 * uses of some kinds of Collections. This is typically worthwhile
 * only when the collections are expected to be large, accessed by
 * more reader threads than writer threads, and entail operations with
 * overhead that outweighs synchronization overhead. For example, here
 * is a class using a TreeMap that is expected to be large and
 * concurrently accessed.
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * class RWDictionary {
 *    private final Map&lt;String, Data&gt; m = new TreeMap&lt;String, Data&gt;();
 *    private final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
 *    private final Lock r = rwl.readLock();
 *    private final Lock w = rwl.writeLock();
 *
 *    public Data get(String key) {
 *        r.lock();
 *        try { return m.get(key); }
 *        finally { r.unlock(); }
 *    }
 *    public String[] allKeys() {
 *        r.lock();
 *        try { return m.keySet().toArray(); }
 *        finally { r.unlock(); }
 *    }
 *    public Data put(String key, Data value) {
 *        w.lock();
 *        try { return m.put(key, value); }
 *        finally { w.unlock(); }
 *    }
 *    public void clear() {
 *        w.lock();
 *        try { m.clear(); }
 *        finally { w.unlock(); }
 *    }
 * }}&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Implementation Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This lock supports a maximum of 65535 recursive write locks
 * and 65535 read locks. Attempts to exceed these limits result in
 * {@link Error} throws from locking methods.
