/**
 * A &lt;tt&gt;Future&lt;/tt&gt; represents the result of an asynchronous
 * computation.  Methods are provided to check if the computation is
 * complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of
 * the computation.  The result can only be retrieved using method
 * &lt;tt&gt;get&lt;/tt&gt; when the computation has completed, blocking if
 * necessary until it is ready.  Cancellation is performed by the
 * &lt;tt&gt;cancel&lt;/tt&gt; method.  Additional methods are provided to
 * determine if the task completed normally or was cancelled. Once a
 * computation has completed, the computation cannot be cancelled.
 * If you would like to use a &lt;tt&gt;Future&lt;/tt&gt; for the sake
 * of cancellability but not provide a usable result, you can
 * declare types of the form &lt;tt&gt;Future&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and
 * return &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt; as a result of the underlying task.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;b&gt;Sample Usage&lt;/b&gt; (Note that the following classes are all
 * made-up.) &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * interface ArchiveSearcher { String search(String target); }
 * class App {
 *   ExecutorService executor = ...
 *   ArchiveSearcher searcher = ...
 *   void showSearch(final String target)
 *       throws InterruptedException {
 *     Future&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; future
 *       = executor.submit(new Callable&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;() {
 *         public String call() {
 *             return searcher.search(target);
 *         }});
 *     displayOtherThings(); // do other things while searching
 *     try {
 *       displayText(future.get()); // use future
 *     } catch (ExecutionException ex) { cleanup(); return; }
 *   }
 * }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * The {@link FutureTask} class is an implementation of &lt;tt&gt;Future&lt;/tt&gt; that
 * implements &lt;tt&gt;Runnable&lt;/tt&gt;, and so may be executed by an &lt;tt&gt;Executor&lt;/tt&gt;.
 * For example, the above construction with &lt;tt&gt;submit&lt;/tt&gt; could be replaced by:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *     FutureTask&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; future =
 *       new FutureTask&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;(new Callable&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;() {
 *         public String call() {
 *           return searcher.search(target);
 *       }});
 *     executor.execute(future);
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Memory consistency effects: Actions taken by the asynchronous computation
 * &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility&quot;&gt; &lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 * actions following the corresponding {@code Future.get()} in another thread.
