/**
 * A service that decouples the production of new asynchronous tasks
 * from the consumption of the results of completed tasks.  Producers
 * &lt;tt&gt;submit&lt;/tt&gt; tasks for execution. Consumers &lt;tt&gt;take&lt;/tt&gt;
 * completed tasks and process their results in the order they
 * complete.  A &lt;tt&gt;CompletionService&lt;/tt&gt; can for example be used to
 * manage asynchronous IO, in which tasks that perform reads are
 * submitted in one part of a program or system, and then acted upon
 * in a different part of the program when the reads complete,
 * possibly in a different order than they were requested.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Typically, a &lt;tt&gt;CompletionService&lt;/tt&gt; relies on a separate
 * {@link Executor} to actually execute the tasks, in which case the
 * &lt;tt&gt;CompletionService&lt;/tt&gt; only manages an internal completion
 * queue. The {@link ExecutorCompletionService} class provides an
 * implementation of this approach.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to
 * submitting a task to a {@code CompletionService}
 * &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 * actions taken by that task, which in turn &lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt;
 * actions following a successful return from the corresponding {@code take()}.
