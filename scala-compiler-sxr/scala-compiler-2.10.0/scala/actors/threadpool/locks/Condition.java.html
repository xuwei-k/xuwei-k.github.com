/**
 * {@code Condition} factors out the {@code Object} monitor
 * methods ({@link Object#wait() wait}, {@link Object#notify notify}
 * and {@link Object#notifyAll notifyAll}) into distinct objects to
 * give the effect of having multiple wait-sets per object, by
 * combining them with the use of arbitrary {@link Lock} implementations.
 * Where a {@code Lock} replaces the use of {@code synchronized} methods
 * and statements, a {@code Condition} replaces the use of the Object
 * monitor methods.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Conditions (also known as &lt;em&gt;condition queues&lt;/em&gt; or
 * &lt;em&gt;condition variables&lt;/em&gt;) provide a means for one thread to
 * suspend execution (to &amp;quot;wait&amp;quot;) until notified by another
 * thread that some state condition may now be true.  Because access
 * to this shared state information occurs in different threads, it
 * must be protected, so a lock of some form is associated with the
 * condition. The key property that waiting for a condition provides
 * is that it &lt;em&gt;atomically&lt;/em&gt; releases the associated lock and
 * suspends the current thread, just like {@code Object.wait}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A {@code Condition} instance is intrinsically bound to a lock.
 * To obtain a {@code Condition} instance for a particular {@link Lock}
 * instance use its {@link Lock#newCondition newCondition()} method.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;As an example, suppose we have a bounded buffer which supports
 * {@code put} and {@code take} methods.  If a
 * {@code take} is attempted on an empty buffer, then the thread will block
 * until an item becomes available; if a {@code put} is attempted on a
 * full buffer, then the thread will block until a space becomes available.
 * We would like to keep waiting {@code put} threads and {@code take}
 * threads in separate wait-sets so that we can use the optimization of
 * only notifying a single thread at a time when items or spaces become
 * available in the buffer. This can be achieved using two
 * {@link Condition} instances.
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * class BoundedBuffer {
 *   &lt;b&gt;final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();&lt;/b&gt;
 *   final Condition notFull  = &lt;b&gt;lock.newCondition(); &lt;/b&gt;
 *   final Condition notEmpty = &lt;b&gt;lock.newCondition(); &lt;/b&gt;
 *
 *   final Object[] items = new Object[100];
 *   int putptr, takeptr, count;
 *
 *   public void put(Object x) throws InterruptedException {
 *     &lt;b&gt;lock.lock();
 *     try {&lt;/b&gt;
 *       while (count == items.length)
 *         &lt;b&gt;notFull.await();&lt;/b&gt;
 *       items[putptr] = x;
 *       if (++putptr == items.length) putptr = 0;
 *       ++count;
 *       &lt;b&gt;notEmpty.signal();&lt;/b&gt;
 *     &lt;b&gt;} finally {
 *       lock.unlock();
 *     }&lt;/b&gt;
 *   }
 *
 *   public Object take() throws InterruptedException {
 *     &lt;b&gt;lock.lock();
 *     try {&lt;/b&gt;
 *       while (count == 0)
 *         &lt;b&gt;notEmpty.await();&lt;/b&gt;
 *       Object x = items[takeptr];
 *       if (++takeptr == items.length) takeptr = 0;
 *       --count;
 *       &lt;b&gt;notFull.signal();&lt;/b&gt;
 *       return x;
 *     &lt;b&gt;} finally {
 *       lock.unlock();
 *     }&lt;/b&gt;
 *   }
 * }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * (The {@link edu.emory.mathcs.backport.java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue} class provides
 * this functionality, so there is no reason to implement this
 * sample usage class.)
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A {@code Condition} implementation can provide behavior and semantics
 * that is
 * different from that of the {@code Object} monitor methods, such as
 * guaranteed ordering for notifications, or not requiring a lock to be held
 * when performing notifications.
 * If an implementation provides such specialized semantics then the
 * implementation must document those semantics.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Note that {@code Condition} instances are just normal objects and can
 * themselves be used as the target in a {@code synchronized} statement,
 * and can have their own monitor {@link Object#wait wait} and
 * {@link Object#notify notification} methods invoked.
 * Acquiring the monitor lock of a {@code Condition} instance, or using its
 * monitor methods, has no specified relationship with acquiring the
 * {@link Lock} associated with that {@code Condition} or the use of its
 * {@linkplain #await waiting} and {@linkplain #signal signalling} methods.
 * It is recommended that to avoid confusion you never use {@code Condition}
 * instances in this way, except perhaps within their own implementation.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Except where noted, passing a {@code null} value for any parameter
 * will result in a {@link NullPointerException} being thrown.
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Implementation Considerations&lt;/h3&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;When waiting upon a {@code Condition}, a &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;spurious
 * wakeup&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; is permitted to occur, in
 * general, as a concession to the underlying platform semantics.
 * This has little practical impact on most application programs as a
 * {@code Condition} should always be waited upon in a loop, testing
 * the state predicate that is being waited for.  An implementation is
 * free to remove the possibility of spurious wakeups but it is
 * recommended that applications programmers always assume that they can
 * occur and so always wait in a loop.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The three forms of condition waiting
 * (interruptible, non-interruptible, and timed) may differ in their ease of
 * implementation on some platforms and in their performance characteristics.
 * In particular, it may be difficult to provide these features and maintain
 * specific semantics such as ordering guarantees.
 * Further, the ability to interrupt the actual suspension of the thread may
 * not always be feasible to implement on all platforms.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Consequently, an implementation is not required to define exactly the
 * same guarantees or semantics for all three forms of waiting, nor is it
 * required to support interruption of the actual suspension of the thread.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;An implementation is required to
 * clearly document the semantics and guarantees provided by each of the
 * waiting methods, and when an implementation does support interruption of
 * thread suspension then it must obey the interruption semantics as defined
 * in this interface.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;As interruption generally implies cancellation, and checks for
 * interruption are often infrequent, an implementation can favor responding
 * to an interrupt over normal method return. This is true even if it can be
 * shown that the interrupt occurred after another action may have unblocked
 * the thread. An implementation should document this behavior.
